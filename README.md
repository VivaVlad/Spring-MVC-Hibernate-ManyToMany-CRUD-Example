# Spring-MVC-Hibernate-ManyToMany-CRUD-Example
If you want to see how program works you need:
  1) open this project in Intellij IDEA;
  2) create database named "spring" in WampServer or MySQL;
  3) create tables (sql listing is in sql folder).
  4) run project using Tomcat server.
  5) visit http://localhost:8080 (or another port you will use).
Thank you for visit ;)
